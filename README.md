## Project Overview

The 2023 Stack Overflow Developer Survey is one of the most comprehensive datasets on the state of software development. This notebook focuses on answering the following key questions:

- What percentage of developers contribute to open source?
- How are developer salaries distributed globally?
- How satisfied are developers with their jobs in different countries?
- What is the relationship between a developer's age and employment status?
- What are the most commonly used social media platforms among developers?
- Which operating systems are preferred by developers?
- Why do developers frequently update their résumés?
- What languages are developers currently using vs. what they aspire to use?
- What types of work locations (remote/hybrid/on-site) are most preferred?

Each of these topics is supported by visual analysis and data-driven insights.
